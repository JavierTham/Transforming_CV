```

## Train a model


## Validate model

## Further work


## References
Models are taken from [timm](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) and [torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision)

## Using weights and biases
[Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) is a free (for personal use) MLOps platform that can be integrated easily with pytorch/tensorflow/keras/fastai and other frameworks easily
